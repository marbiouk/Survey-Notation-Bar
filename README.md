Ever had to undertake surveys in which you had to photograph numerous quadrats, using different cameras or even by different surveyors? In this case, you might want to try making a colour scale bar that can be used across surveys.

To achieve this, I created a small colour scale that can be added to the edge of quadrats, or even used freestyle! It consists of two plastic parts, and a laminated print that incorporates a free note field, a date field, a 50mm scale and a graduated colour/gray scale test bar that can be used to check and standardise camera settings.

####Files provided
* Colour_scale.psd
  * Photoshop file of the graduated colour and grayscale bar used to allow camera standardisation (see notes).
* olour_scale.png
  * PNG version of above.
* Survey_notation_bar.pdf
  * Layered PDF of the survey notation bar, and plastic part outlines, you only need to print the "Print" layer.
* Survey_notation_bar.png
  * 600 dpi PNG version of the above without the plastic part outlines.
* Survey_notation_bar.dxf
  * Autodesk interchange file of the survey notation bar plastic parts in mm for laser cutting.
* Survey_notation_bar.cb
  * CamBam file of the plastic parts used to program my laser cutter (you will probably not need this).

####Equipment used
* Laser cutting machine
* Colour printer (laser or inkjet)
* Laminator
* Scissors (or craft knife and rule)

####Materials needed
* Paper
* Lamination film
* Acrylic plastic
* Cable ties (optional)
* Superglue

####Guide
1. Using a colour printer, print our the print layer from Survey_Bar.pdf, trim to the outer rectangle using scissors or a craft knife.
2. Laminate this using a laminator and laminating film, and then trim that. Make sure you leave about 5 mm of plastic around the outside of the trimmed part. This will allow you to stick it well inbetween the acrylic sheets.
3. Laser cut the acrylic shapes, you should have a bottom part and a top part.
4. Stick the printed bar to the bottom plate, using superglue and then position the top part, to create a sandwich with the laminated paper in the middle. You can use cable ties to secure the two parts together until the glue dries.

####Using it!
All you need is a white board or permanent maker (plus alcohol wipes) and you have a fully functioning survey marker with standardised colour scale that can be customised to show the date, and quadrat number/location. A highly valuable tool when on survey.

####Notes
The inspiration for the colour scale was found [here]( http://www.digitalsecrets.net/secrets/portabledarkroom.html). According to this source, on the top bar you should be able to make out 11 rectangles of grays ranging from white to black. Each step is identical in size. The colours, are an equal 30 degrees around a colour wheel.
